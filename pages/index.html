		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		
		<p>Many people already prototype in the browser. It's simple and quick. But while html/js/css/jquery gets a lot done it has some downsides:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>It can get pretty complicated mixing all the different technologies</li>
			<li>It can be hard to get the pixel perfect control you want</li>
			<li>It's not always performant, especially on mobile</li>
			<li>It's pretty far from how it will be actually implemented if you prototype for native</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Framer tries to solve some of these problems by providing a very lightweight framework modeled after larger application frameworks. The basic idea is that you only need a few simple building blocks like images, animation and events to build and test complex interactions.</p>

		<p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/rsms">Rasmus</a> excellent <a href="http://rsms.me/uilayer/">UILayer</a>, it uses modern webkit technologies to leverage the graphics card, so it runs smooth on both desktop and mobile.</p>

		<p>Framer can be seen as an alternative to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash.html">Flash</a> or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/graphics-and-animation.html">Quartz Composer</a>. It's targeted at designers that can do basic javascript, up until experienced interface programmers.</p>
