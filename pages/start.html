### Framer.js
<strong>Framer</strong> consists of 2 parts – the Framework and Generator.

The core of Framer is a Javascript <strong>Framework</strong> that enables you to define interactions and animations in a simple, readable way. It's a small framer.js file that makes creating realistic prototypes a breeze – complete with animations, spring physics and 3D effects.

Framer <strong>Generator</strong> optimizes the flow of going from static mockups to interactive prototypes. It's a desktop application that extracts the resources and layer hierarchy out of <!-- Sketch or  -->Photoshop files (Sketch coming soon) and renders them to a Framer project folder, where you can easily add interaction and animation to the layers.

### Installation
To get started, <a href="/static/downloads/Framer.zip">download</a> Framer and unzip it. Here's what you get:

<a name="installation"></a>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Project folder</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>app.js</li>
			<li>index.html</li>
			<li>Framer folder</li>
			<li>Images folder </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Framer Generator.app</strong></li>
</ul>

Open index.html to view the default prototype and you'll see the logo bounce on a click. To add interactions and animations, start editing app.js (in your code-editor). Try it by adding a state to imageLayer:

<pre><code data-language="coffeescript">fifth: { y:200, scale:0.8, rotationZ:200, blur:2 }</code></pre>

The imageLayer will now move up, scale, rotate and blur on the fourth click. Framer works, congrats! Note: Framer runs best in WebKit, so please use Safari. Chrome works too, but has been rocky since they switched to Blink.

#### JavaScript

Framer makes it easier to prototype animations and interactions, but you will benefit from understanding a bit of JavaScript. If you don't know JavaScript or are just beginning, don't worry. There are many great resources to get started and while it might seem hard at first you'll see that you'll get better quickly. It's also good to know that JavaScript is worth learning apart from Framer, as you can do web, application, and backend development with it.

### Generator

<img src="/static/images/icon-generator.png" class="2x" style="float:left; padding:8px 20px 0px 0">

The Framer Generator.app takes static mockups from <!-- <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch</a> or  --><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Photoshop</a> (Sketch coming soon) and turns them into ready-to-go Framer projects. From these apps, it extracts resources and folder hierarchy so you can start adding interactions and animations immediately.

 
With a <!-- Sketch or  -->Photoshop file active, open Framer Generator and click <strong>Import</strong>. Only layer groups are imported; single layers are ignored. The hierarchy of your groups determine the layer hierarchy in Framer. After importing you will be presented with a folder containing your Framer project.

Open index.html to view the project, and start editing app.js to add behavior. You can safely move things around in <!-- Sketch or  -->Photoshop and import again. Framer Generator will update the images and hierarchy, but leave your code safe.

The basics for converting <!-- Sketch and  -->Photoshop files:
<ul>
	<li>Every layer group will become a Framer Layer, with an image of all the layers</li>
	<li>By default your layers are imported under a myLayers object</li>
	<li>Access any layer by its group name: myLayers.GroupName or myLayers["Group Name"]. For example, if you had a layer group named 'avatar' in Photoshop, you would access it in Framer with myLayers.avatar</li>
	<li>Framer respects the group hierarchy, so a group in a group will become a subLayer</li>
	<li>Groups with vector masks will become layers with clip enabled</li>
	<li>Group names should be unique. If they're not, Framer will rename them on export</li>
</ul>
